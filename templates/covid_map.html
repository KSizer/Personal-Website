            <p><strong>Description</strong></p>
            <p>
                I built this page to get more familiar with bokehs' javascript interactivity and to improve my ability to work with geographic data. In hindsight, I would have used a different 
                package for a mapping project since bokeh tiles work in mercator instead of lat/lon but it made for a good learning experience. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The map uses publically available data from the UK government on covid cases and population. I used a data set I found on kaggel for the regions geojson 
                but this information is also available from Ordinance Survey if you want a more detailed dataset and I have included a link to it below.

    <p><strong>Technical description</strong></p>
    <p>
        I wanted to give some more information about what is going on when a user clicks on a region. Bokeh has the ability to react to certain events such as mouse movement across the chart,
        users interacting with the chart elements or certain tools being used. When Bokeh detects one of the events it can execute some javascript code in reaction to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        What is happening in the chart above is that there is an event listening for when a selection change occurs. In this case the elements that can be selected are the regions on the map and when
        a region is selected a piece of javascript code is executed that dynamically updates the values in the modal popup based on which region is selected. This includes the text elements as well
        as the chart.
    </p>
    <p>
        The flowchart below describes how the process is executed.
